  - 'Survival, I am G.R.E.G (Growth-oriented Responsive Enhanced Guide). How may
    I be of service to you '
  - "Oh Yes, the Sulfur town. Those poor people, to think about the fear and turmoil
    they must be experiencing\u2026.so sad"
  - Of course, dear good sir. I am linked with a human, after all. Anthawn, I am
    sure you met him before coming to this floor.
  - "Great! It makes explaining who he is to you easier, giving us time to jump into
    it. Sulfur is the second smallest town under our care, but don\u2019t underestimate
    its size; it\u2019s still a lot for one person, which is why we divide your task
    into sections. Completing the assigned task, we will pick you up and take you
    to the next. Our biggest priority is sealing off the bridge, eliminating the
    pests, and securing the civilians\u2026.The General wants me to add, don\u2019t
    die. "
  - ' Lucky for you, Anthawn and his team of  Gregs predict such a possible invasion
    and bridge that we set up multiple Safe Zones across nearby towns with our tag,
    The Green Flag, where our Elite can rest and upgrade their gear. Such gears are
    attached to the gun and programmed to function only on each run based on the
    challenges ahead.'
  - 'Furthermore, we could only borrow enough power from the home base to power up
    a single upgrade station per Safe Zones, so make it count '

    to be attached to it. Please shake and blame the close programmer for proceeding'
