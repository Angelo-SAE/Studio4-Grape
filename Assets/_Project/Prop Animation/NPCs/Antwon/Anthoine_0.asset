  - Hey, you are awake. I guess I owed the Colonel a drink.
  - Nevermind. I am Anthoine. I run comms with all members in and out of the base.
  - 'I''m the one who found you. Unfortunately, we got there too late and.... never
    mind. '
  - Anyway, I am busy right now, but I am sure the Colonel will want to talk to you.
    Once you find him, feel free to engage with one of my Gregs for your briefing.
  - I am sure the Colonel will be more than happy to answer all of your questions
  - 'It has been a while since I''ve seen him but talk to Doctor Saif on the second
    floor. He should know a thing or two. '
