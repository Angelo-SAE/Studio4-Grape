  - (Comms Vibrates) Excuse me, I have to take this
  - "Yeah\u2026\u2026Yeah\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. What?!........... Okay, calm
    down. I am heading down heading to my office; meet me there."
  - Well, kid, I have to go
  - "There\u2019s an urgent matter in which I am needed, and so are you"
  - Look, I don't like it any more than you do. I would have preferred to run more
    tests before putting you in the field, but desperate times call for desperate
    measures.
  - 'Those filthy bugs are invading a nearby town whose residents sought out shelter
    in the bunker '
  - They are fighting for their lives, and all of our Elite are out patrolling other
    areas; if we do call them back, it would be far too late. We need someone trained
    who is not afraid of getting his hands dirty
  - "I have seen you with a weapon, and there\u2019s no man I would rather have on
    the job. I just hope it\u2019s not too early. "
  - "We need the bridge to the town sealed off. You will have to fight your way to
    it while staying alive. That\u2019s a direct order."
  - 'Talk to Greg when you are ready to leave, and Captain.. '
  - 'Godspeed '
